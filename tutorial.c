 * This tutorial follows the slides from "Le langage C," created by:

 * However, the explanations are written in my own style.
 * Also I added some extra things.

 * TL;DR: C is a cool language.
 * TL;DR: "Too Long; Didn't Read"
 * -----------------------------
 *
 * C is a programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in
 * 1972. It was derived from 'ALGOL', 'BCPL', and 'B' programming languages,
 * with the goal of combining the best elements of high-level languages with the
 * control and flexibility of assembly.
 *
 * By 1973, the entire UNIX operating system was rewritten in C.
 *
 * In 1978, "The C Programming Language" was published, now commonly referred to
 * as the "K&R standard" after its authors, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.
 * Some enthusiasts consider this book the "Bible" of the C language.
 *
 * During the 1980s, C was primarily associated with UNIX development, and
 * numerous dialects emerged due to the lack of standardized version control
 * (*as K&R themselves noted*). A highly influential organization, ANSI
 * (American National Standards Institute), established a formal standard for C
 * in 1989, which was later approved by ISO (International Organization for
 * Standardization) in 1990. This version became known as "ANSI C."
 *
 * Subsequent updates have been made to the language, with the latest version
 * being C23.

#include <stdio.h>

/* This is the function that the program will execute when executing (never
 * better said) the program. Is also called the "main" function.
 *
 * ```c
 * int main (void)
 * int main ()
 * int main (int argc, char *argv[])
 * int main (int argc, char ** argv)
 * ```
 *
 * you are free to go with this options, but if you ever put
 * ```aberration
 * void main()
 * ```
 * I will appear in your dreams.
 * More later on the return types. But for now, just keep in mind main always
 * return an

    /* To declare a variable, we write:
     * <data_type> <variable_name>; */
    char first_letter;
    /* Boom, variable declared.
     *
     * Let's first talk about data types:
     *
     * List of basic data types and is usual sizes:
     * | char: 1 byte
     * | short: 2 bytes
     * | int: 4 bytes
     * | long int: (4 bytes on x32, 8 bytes on x64)
     * | long long int: (8 bytes)
     * | float: 4 bytes
     * | double: (8 bytes)
     *
     *
     * There are also "unsigned" data types.
     * Let me explain what that keyword does with an example:
     *
     * Here we have a short:    || Here we have an unsigned short:
     * 00000000 00000000        00000000 00000000
     * ^ sign bit.              ^.....
     * Did you notice something?
     * Yeah, the unsigned short "ignores" the sign bit, so all values are
     * positive. That's why our short goes from  -2^15      to  2^15 - 1 -32,768
     * to  32,767 and our unsigned short goes from      0    to  2^16 - 1 0 to
     * 65,535
     *
     * To know the size of a data type, just use sizeof()! */
    printf("%zu\n", sizeof(long int));

    /* to say something is true, just use an integer!
     * 0                            => false!
     * every another f****** value  => true!
     *
     * if you are coding in C99 or above, you can always import
     * <bool.h>!
     * with:
     * > `#import <bool.h>`
     *
     * you will be able to:
     *
     * ```c
     * bool i_am_fine = false;
     * bool are_you_reading_this = true; // probably false.
     * ```
     *
     * we are cool guys so we won't import bool.h.
     *
     * Let's practice a bit! (and give values to our data)...
